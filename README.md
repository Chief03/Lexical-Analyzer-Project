Lexical-Analyzer-Project is a C-based implementation designed to perform lexical analysis on input text, typically as a first phase in the compilation or interpretation of programming languages. The analyzer processes source code or text files, breaking them down into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and punctuation, which are then used for further syntactic or semantic analysis. This project is useful for understanding compiler construction and language processing fundamentals.
